                    <p>Hello, my name is Ryan Do. I'm a Digital Marketing student at Bellevue College, and I recently added Web Development to my skillset. I did a little bit of coding with HTML and CSS in an intro to computer science class in high school, so I went into BATECH 189 with some experience. But since that was almost a full decade ago, I thought that it would be a good time to familiarize myself with the entire process again and learn about new concepts I had no experience with before. To my suprise, it's been a lot more fun than I remembered.</p>
                    <p>This class has been very interesting and fulfilling overall. There's few other courses in my program where you get to leave with a complete portfolio to show off. That's not just something that looks good on a resume. Having websites uploaded on Github that I can send to people just like any other link provides a real, tangible value. It's different than sending someone an essay you wrote. This is something that I can say I built from scratch. Everything from the layout to the color scheme to even the semantic HTML that I decided to use all has my own unique personality incorporated in it. It's an art form. Web development can be as simple or as complex as you like. It's all up to you.</p>
